The main principle behind the ensemble model is that a group of weak learners come together to form a strong learner, thus increasing the accuracy of the model.When we try to predict the target variable using any machine learning technique, the main causes of difference in actual and predicted values are noise, variance, and bias. Ensemble helps to reduce these factors (except noise, which is irreducible error). The noise-related error is mainly due to noise in the training data and can't be removed. However, the errors due to bias and variance can be reduced.\n","The total error can be expressed as follows: \n","\n","### Total Error = Bias + Variance + Irreducible Error \n","\n","![Imgur](https://imgur.com/q4Egoes.png)\n","\n","# Why we do Bootstrap re-sampling\n","\n","Bootstrapping resamples the original dataset with replacement many thousands of times to create simulated datasets. This process involves drawing random samples from the original dataset. Through bootstrapping you are simply taking samples over and over again from the same group of data (your sample data) to estimate how accurate your estimates about the entire population (what really is out there in the real world) is.\n","\n","If you were to take one sample and make estimates on the real population, you might not be able to estimate how accurate your estimates are - we only have one estimate and have not identified how this estimate varies with different samples that we might have encountered.\n","\n","### Bootstrap Aggregation (or Bagging for short), is a simple and very powerful ensemble method.\n","\n","An ensemble method is a technique that combines the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms together to make more accurate predictions than any individual model.\n","\n","Bootstrap Aggregation is a general procedure that can be used to reduce the variance for those algorithm that have high variance. An algorithm that has high variance are decision trees, like classification and regression trees (CART).\n","\n","Decision trees are sensitive to the specific data on which they are trained. If the training data is changed (e.g. a tree is trained on a subset of the training data) the resulting decision tree can be quite different and in turn the predictions can be quite different.\n","\n","Bagging is the application of the Bootstrap procedure to a high-variance machine learning algorithm, typically decision trees.\n","\n","Another major drawback associated with the tree classifiers is that they are unstable. That is, a small\n","change in the training data set can result in a very different tree. The reason for this lies in the\n","hierarchical nature of the tree classifiers. An error that occurs in a node at a high level of the tree\n","propagates all the way down to the leaves below it.\n","\n","\n","And so Bagging (bootstrap aggregating) can reduce the variance and improve the\n","generalization error performance. The basic idea is to create B variants, X1, X2 , . . . , XB , of the\n","training set X, using bootstrap techniques, by uniformly sampling from X with replacement. For\n","each of the training set variants Xi , a tree Ti is constructed. The final decision for the classification\n","of a given point is in favor of the class predicted by the majority of the subclassifiers Ti , i =\n","1, 2, . . . , B.\n","\n","# Finally Principle of Random Forest with Bootstrapping\n","\n","The below text is taken from [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8950481) source\n","\n","Firstly, using Bootstrap resampling technique, multiple samples are randomly selected from the original training sample set x to generate a new training sample set. Then, multiple decision trees are constructed to form random forest. Finally, the random forest averages the output of each decision tree to determine the final filling result y. Due to the Bootstrap used in the random decision tree generation process, all samples are not used in a decision tree and the unused samples are called out of band (OOB). Through out of band, the accuracy of the tree can be evaluated. The other trees are evaluated according to the principle and finally average the results\n","\n","![Imgur](https://imgur.com/qj2c3ur.png)\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Now our Code Implementations\n","\n","### There will be some functions that start with the word \"grader\" ex: grader_sampples(), grader_30().. etc, we should not change those function definition.
