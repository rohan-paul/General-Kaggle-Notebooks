    " For example, in a three-dimensional space, the data may cluster around a straight line, or around the circumference of a circle or the graph of a parabola, arbitrarily placed in R^3. In all previous cases, the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is equal to one, as any of these curves can equivalently\n",

    "Below figure illustrates the three cases. Learning the lower-dimensional structure associated with a given set of data is gaining in importance in the context of big data processing and analysis. Some typical examples are the disciplines of computer vision, robotics, medical imaging, and computational neuroscience.\n",

In all three cases, the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is equal to one. In (A) the data are clustered around a (translated/affine) linear subspace and in (B) and (C) around one-dimensional manifolds.\n",
