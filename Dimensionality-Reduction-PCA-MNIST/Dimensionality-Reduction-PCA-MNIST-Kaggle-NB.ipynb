    "\n",
    "In many practical applications, although the data reside in a high-dimensional space, the true dimensionality, known as intrinsic dimensionality, can be of a much lower value.\n",
    "\n",
    " For example, in a three-dimensional space, the data may cluster around a straight line, or around the circumference of a circle or the graph of a parabola, arbitrarily placed in R^3. In all previous cases, the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is equal to one, as any of these curves can equivalently\n",
    "be described in terms of a single parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below figure illustrates the three cases. Learning the lower-dimensional structure associated with a given set of data is gaining in importance in the context of big data processing and analysis. Some typical examples are the disciplines of computer vision, robotics, medical imaging, and computational neuroscience.\n",

    "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction may be both linear or non-linear, depending upon the method used. The prime linear method, called Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is discussed below.\n",

    "\n",
    "## When should I use Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of PCA as an exploratory technique to investigate and study your system before doing other things. Dimensionality reduction, by nature, loses some information, just like image compression for instance. Consequently, it will often reduce the prediction quality of your model, but depending on the data it could also leave it unchanged or even improve it in some cases (very noisy data). In general, its main benefit will be to speed up training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides speed of training, feature reduction also help with multicollinearity in some cases. Which is mainly an issue if you are interested in parameters estimation, like in causal analysis. For instance, if you use a multiple linear regression model to estimate the effect of some regressors on a dependent variable, multicollinearity will prevent proper parameters estimation because you won't be able to identify the effect of each regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in many other ML applications, we don't really care about parameters identification, we care about how a set of variables can be used to predict another variable. If some variables are highly correlated, then there will be some redundant information in your data, but this shouldn't be problematic in terms of prediction quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, in couple of Kaggle Challenges, after doing some PCA, the accuracy has actually went down. After googling found out that some infer that PCA assumed that the variance could translate to high differentiable information which classifier could use. But at the same time, it threw some information away(not just noise), and these information could play a huge role in classification, although the variance is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation for dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no best technique for dimensionality reduction and no mapping of techniques to problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the best approach is to use systematic controlled experiments to discover what dimensionality reduction techniques, when paired with your model of choice, result in the best performance on your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, linear algebra and manifold learning methods assume that all input features have the same scale or distribution. This suggests that it is good practice to either normalize or standardize data prior to using these methods if the input variables have differing scales or units.\n",

    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/1KUD3gN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 2 methods, Feature Selection and PCA reduce the dimension of the feature space, or in other words the number of rows in a data matrix. However, the two methods work differently: while feature selection literally selects rows from the original matrix to keep, PCA uses the geometry of the feature space to produce a new data matrix based on a lower feature dimensional version of the data. K-means, on the other hand, reduces the dimension of the data/number of data points, or equivalently the number of columns in the input data matrix. It does so by finding a small number of new averaged representatives or “centroids” of the input data, forming a new data matrix whose fewer columns (which are not\n",
    "present in the original data matrix) are precisely these centroids.\n",

    "\n",
    "PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. Here is what Wikipedia says about PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Given a collection of points in two, three, or higher dimensional space, a “best fitting” line can be defined as one that minimizes the average squared distance from a point to the line. The next best-fitting line can be similarly chosen from directions perpendicular to the first. Repeating this process yields an orthogonal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are uncorrelated. These basis vectors are called principal components, and several related procedures principal component analysis (PCA).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So, PCA means extracting the components (features) which are most effective in forecasting the target variable in a dataset, and discarding the redundant features. Thus, we calculate the Principal Components to achieve Dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA ( aka Karhunen–Loève transform in Mathematics ) is among the oldest and most widely used methods for dimensionality reduction [105]. The assumption underlying PCA, as well as any dimensionality reduction technique, is that the observed data are generated by a system or process that is driven by a (relatively) small number of latent (not directly observed) variables. The goal is to learn this latent structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a visual representation of PCA being applied to a simple 2-D data set (left, in blue)\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/lKK6Gts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see above dimension reduction via PCA retains much of the structure of the original data. The ideal subspace is shown in black in the left panel, and the data projected onto this subspace is shown in blue on the right. (bottom panels)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using PCA, we must standardize our dataset. The method won’t work if we have entirely different scales for our data. Standardization helps to avoid biased outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose there are three variables – v1 in a 1-10 range, v2 in a 10-100 range, and v3 in a 100,000 to 1,000,000 range. If we just go ahead and compute an output using these predictors, we’ll get a heavily biased result because the third variable will have a disproportionately large impact on the output value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-1 So, Before applying PCA, we must ensure that all our attributes (dimensions) are centered around zero and have a standard deviation of 1. So, the first thing we do is calculate the means for all of them. Then, we center the values in each column (to do so we subtract the mean column value) and calculate the covariance matrix for the resulting centered matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate our first principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-2 - Next, we utilize one of the methods for breaking up matrices (eigendecomposition or singular value decomposition) to turn our matrix into a list of eigenvectors that will define directions of axes in the new subspace and eigenvalues that will show the magnitude of those directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We sort the vectors by their eigenvalues in decreasing order and thus get a ranking of the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-3 - Now finally, we can ditch some of the dimensions and project our dataset into a reduced subspace without losing important information about the original dataset. And since new axes capture the maximum variance in the data, any clustering algorithm we’re going to apply next will have an easier time grouping the data instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at it visually,\n",

    "As the data points in this case are spreading diagonally so we need a new line that would better capture this.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/B9MtmIg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This axis is our first Principle Component (PC) – a new direction (we can imagine it to be an attribute) that maximizes the variance of the data (and thus the clusters become much more obvious.) Besides maximizing the spread, this first PC sits through the direction in the data that minimizes the distances between all the points and the new axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The second PC must represent the second maximum amount of variance; it’s going to be a line that’s orthogonal to our first axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/ocDf36C.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the underlying PCA-Math being based on eigenvectors and eigenvalues, new principal components will always come out orthogonal to the ones before them. **Eigenvectors**, simply, are vectors that aren’t knocked off of their span by a linear transformation; they can hold on to their original direction while being stretched, shrunk or reversed. Eigenvalues are factors by which these special vectors are scaled.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key concept of Preserving the Variance by Projection of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before we can project the training set onto a lower-dimensional hyperplane, we first need to choose the right hyperplane. For example, in the below figure, a simple 2D dataset is represented on the left, along with three different axes (i.e., 1D hyperplanes). On the right is the result of the projection of the dataset onto each of these axes. As we can see, the projection onto the solid line preserves the maximum variance, while the projection onto the dotted line preserves very little variance and the projection onto the dashed line preserves an intermediate amount of variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/Fp8kqgJ.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### It seems reasonable to select the axis that preserves the maximum amount of variance, as it will most likely lose less information than the other projections. Another way to justify this choice is that it is the axis that minimizes the mean squared distance between the original dataset and its projection onto that axis. This is the basic idea behind PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA identifies the axis that accounts for the largest amount of variance in the train-ing set. In above figure, it is the solid line. It also finds a second axis, orthogonal to the first one, that accounts for the largest amount of remaining variance. In this 2D example there is no choice: it is the dotted line (i.e. the orthogonal one). If it were a higher-dimensional data‐set, PCA would also find a third axis, orthogonal to both previous axes, and a fourth, a fifth, and so on—as many axes as the number of dimensions in the dataset. The ith axis is called the ith principal component (PC) of the data. In above figure, the first PC is the axis on which vector c1 lies, and the second PC is the axis on which vector c2 lies. In case of 3-D dataset the first two PCs are the orthogonal axes on which the two arrows lie, on the plane, and the third PC is the axis orthogonal to that plane, like in the below figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/wEHwUMl.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For each principal component, PCA finds a zero-centered unit vector pointing in the direction of the PC. Since two opposing unit vectors lie on the same axis, the direction of the unit vectors returned by PCA is not stable: if you perturb the training set slightly and run PCA again, the unit vectors may point in the oppo‐\n",
    "site direction as the original vectors. However, they will generally still lie on the same axes. In some cases, a pair of unit vectors may even rotate or swap (if the variances along these two axes are close), but the plane they define will generally remain the same.\n",

    "\n",
    "A sequential model, which is a linear stack of layers as the name suggests, allows you to create models layer-by-layer in a step-by-step fashion. Keras Sequential API is by far the easiest way to get up and running with Keras, but it is s also the most limited — you cannot create models that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Share layers\n",
    "Have branches (at least not easily)\n",
    "Have multiple inputs\n",
    "Have multiple outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The model needs to know what input shape it should expect. For this reason, the first layer in a sequential model (and only the first, because following layers can do automatic shape inference) needs to receive information about its input shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in the example above, this is done by passing an input_shape argument to the first layer. This is a list of integers or NULL entries, where NULL indicates that any positive integer may be expected. In input_shape, the batch dimension is not included.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever need to specify a fixed batch size for your inputs (this is useful for stateful recurrent networks), you can pass a batch_size argument to a layer. If you pass both batch_size=32 and input_shape=c(6, 8) to a layer, it will then expect every batch of inputs to have the batch shape (32, 6, 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The activation parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation parameter to the Conv2D class is simply a convenience parameter, allowing you to supply a string specifying the name of the activation function you want to apply after performing the convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Activation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ReLU is the most used activation function in the world right now.Since, it is used in almost all the convolutional neural networks or deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ReLU function is f(x)=max(0,x).\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/2ezpnE3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the ReLU is half rectified (from bottom). f(z) is zero when z is less than zero and f(z) is equal to z when z is above or equal to zero.\n",
    "Range: [ 0 to infinity)\n",
    "The function and its derivative both are monotonic.\n",
    "But the issue is that all the negative values become zero immediately which decreases the ability of the model to fit or train from the data properly. That means any negative input given to the ReLU activation function turns the value into zero immediately in the graph, which in turns affects the resulting graph by not mapping the negative values appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way ReLUs improve neural networks is by speeding up training. The gradient computation is very simple (either 0 or 1 depending on the sign of x). Also, the computational step of a ReLU is easy: any negative elements are set to 0.0 -- no exponentials, no multiplication or division operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradients of logistic and hyperbolic tangent networks are smaller than the positive portion of the ReLU. This means that the positive portion is updated more rapidly as training progresses. However, this comes at a cost. The 0 gradient on the left-hand side is has its own problem, called \"dead neurons,\" in which a gradient update sets the incoming values to a ReLU such that the output is always zero; modified ReLU units such as ELU (or Leaky ReLU, or PReLU, etc.) can ameliorate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BatchNormalization in Keras -\n",
    "\n",
    "The layer will transform inputs so that they are standardized, meaning that they will have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the layer will keep track of statistics for each input variable and use them to standardize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the standardized output can be scaled using the learned parameters of Beta and Gamma that define the new mean and standard deviation for the output of the transform. The layer can be configured to control whether these additional parameters will be used or not via the “center” and “scale” attributes respectively. By default, they are enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistics used to perform the standardization, e.g. the mean and standard deviation of each variable, are updated for each mini batch and a running average is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "A “momentum” argument allows you to control how much of the statistics from the previous mini batch to include when the update is calculated. By default, this is kept high with a value of 0.99. This can be set to 0.0 to only use statistics from the current mini-batch, as described in the original paper.\n",

    "Kernel: In image processing kernel is a convolution matrix or masks which can be used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more by doing a convolution between a kernel and an image.\n",

    "#### Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "The first required Conv2D parameter is the number of filters that the convolutional layer will learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/j38MUoW.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras Conv2D parameter, filters determines the number of kernels to convolve with the input volume. Each of these operations produces a 2D activation map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Layers early in the network architecture (i.e., closer to the actual input image) learn fewer convolutional filters while layers deeper in the network (i.e., closer to the output predictions) will learn more filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conv2D layers in between will learn more filters than the early Conv2D layers but fewer filters than the layers closer to the output. Let’s go ahead and take a look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "So filter is a mandatory Conv2D parameter. It is an integer value and also determines the number of output filters in the convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "`model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size = 3, activation='relu', input_shape = input_shape))`\n",
    "\n",
    "In above line we are learning a total of 32 filters.\n",
    "As far as choosing the appropriate value for no. of filters, it is always recommended to use powers of 2 as the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more on Keras Conv2D [here](https://missinglink.ai/guides/keras/keras-conv2d-working-cnn-2d-convolutions-keras/) - Some excerpts from this\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a 2D Convolution Layer, the Convolution Kernel and its Role in CNN Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, some background. A convolution layer “scans” A source image with a filter of, for example, 5×5 pixels, to extract features which may be important for classification. This filter is also called the convolution kernel. The kernel also contains weights, which are tuned in the training of the model to achieve the most accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 5×5 kernel, for each 5×5 pixel region, the model computes the dot products between the image pixel values and the weights defined in the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2D convolution layer means that the input of the convolution operation is three-dimensional, for example, a color image which has a value for each pixel across three layers: red, blue and green. However, it is called a “2D convolution” because the movement of the filter across the image happens in two dimensions. The filter is run across the image three times, once for each of the three layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the convolution ends, the features are downsampled, and then the same convolutional structure repeats again. At first, the convolution identifies features in the original image (for example in a cat, the body, legs, tail, head), then it identifies sub-features within smaller parts of the image (for example, within the head, the ears, whiskers, eyes). Eventually, this process is meant to identify the essential features that can help classify the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The kernel_size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel_size must be an odd integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical values for kernel_size include: (1, 1) , (3, 3) , (5, 5) , (7, 7) . It’s rare to see kernel sizes larger than 7×7.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when do you use each?\n",
    "\n",
    "If your input images are greater than 128×128 you may choose to use a kernel size > 3 to help (1) learn larger spatial filters and (2) to help reduce volume size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### strides\n",
    "\n",
    "The strides parameter is a 2-tuple of integers, specifying the “step” of the convolution along the x and y axis of the input volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strides value defaults to (1, 1) , implying that:\n",
    "\n",
    "A given convolutional filter is applied to the current location of the input volume\n",
    "The filter takes a 1-pixel step to the right and again the filter is applied to the input volume\n",
    "This process is performed until we reach the far-right border of the volume in which we move our filter one pixel down and then start again from the far left\n",
    "Typically you’ll leave the strides parameter with the default (1, 1) value; however, you may occasionally increase it to (2, 2) to help reduce the size of the output volume (since the step size of the filter is larger).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically you’ll see strides of 2×2 as a replacement to max pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "### padding\n",
    "\n",
    "The padding parameter to the Keras Conv2D class can take on one of two values: valid or same .\n",
    "\n",
    "With the valid parameter the input volume is not zero-padded and the spatial dimensions are allowed to reduce via the natural application of convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you instead want to preserve the spatial dimensions of the volume such that the output volume size matches the input volume size, then you would want to supply a value of same for the padding :\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "From Tensorflow [Docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dropout)\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter `rate` - Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. Inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by 1/(1 - rate) such that the sum over all inputs is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Dropout layer only applies when training is set to True such that no values are dropped during inference. When using model.fit, training will be appropriately set to True automatically, and in other contexts, you can set the kwarg explicitly to True when calling the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following taken from this very informative [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-and-implementing-dropout-in-tensorflow-and-keras-a8a3a02c1bfa)\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks have hidden layers in between their input and output layers, these hidden layers have neurons embedded within them, and it’s the weights within the neurons along with the interconnection between neurons is what enables the neural network system to learn.\n",
    "The general idea in Neural networks is that the more neurons and layers within a neural network architecture, the greater the representational power it has. This increase in representational power means that the neural network can fit more complex functions and generalize well to training data.\n",
    "Simply kept, there are more configurations for the interconnections between the neurons within the neural network layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage of utilizing deeper neural networks is that they are highly prone to overfitting.\n",
    "Overfitting is a common problem that is defined as the inability for a trained machine learning model to generalized well to unseen data, but the same model performs well on the data it was trained on.\n",
    "The primary purpose of dropout is to minimize the effect of overfitting within a trained network.\n",
    "Dropout technique works by randomly reducing the number of interconnecting neurons within a neural network. At every training step, each neuron has a chance of being left out, or rather, dropped out of the collated contribution from connected neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique minimizes overfitting because each neuron becomes independently sufficient, in the sense that the neurons within the layers learn weight values that are not based on the cooperation of its neighbouring neurons. Supposedly you trained 7,000 different neural network architecture, to select the best one you simply take the average of all 7,000 trained neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the dropout technique actually mimics this scenario.\n",
    "If the probability of a neuron getting dropped out in a training step is set to 0.5; we are actually training a variety of different network at each training step as it’s highly impossible that the same neurons are excluded at any two training steps. Therefore a neural network that has been trained utilizing the dropout technique is an average of all the different neurons connection combinations that have occurred at each training step."
