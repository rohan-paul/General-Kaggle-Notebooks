Beyond Optimization of Neural networks (NN) cost function and variations of gradient descent algorithm here in NN and a plethora of other optimization are handled with multivariate calculus.\n",

    "\n",
    "By now we have seen, the gradient **holds all the partial derivatives** of a multivariable function. Before we dive deep into Gradient-Descent algorithm below, let’s explore the difference between Derivative and Gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The derivative is a **number**, which shows the rate of change when some point in our function _moves_ in a particular direction. We can _visualize the derivative as a slope_ of a function which _goes along some direction on a graph_. We use the letter **d** to denote the derivative.\n",
    "2.  The gradient is, on the other hand, a **vector** which _points_ in the direction of the **steepest ascent or** the greatest upward slope whose length is the directional derivative in that direction\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the symbol ∇ to denote the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So why Gradient is a Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular derivative gives us the rate of change of a single variable. For example, df/dx tells us how much the function f(x) changes for a change in x. But if a function takes multiple variables, such as x and y, it will have multiple derivatives: the value of the function will change when we change x (df/dx) and also when we change y (df/dy).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now we can represent these multiple rates of change in a vector, with one component for each derivative. Thus, a function that takes 3 variables will have a gradient with 3 components each represented by a partial derivative. And just like the regular derivative, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest increase. However, now that we have multiple directions to consider (x, y, and z), the direction of greatest increase is no longer simply “forward” or “backward” along the x-axis, like it is with functions of a single variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two variables, then our 2-component gradient can specify any direction on a plane. Likewise, with 3 variables, the gradient can specify and direction in 3D space to move to increase our function.\n",

    "Now it will make sense of the **below definition of Gradient**. The gradient of vector-valued function\n",
