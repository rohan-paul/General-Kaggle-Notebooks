    "\n",
    "In general, the first axis (axis 0, because indexing starts at 0) in all data tensors you’ll come across in deep learning will be the samples axis (sometimes called the samples dimension). In the MNIST example, samples are images of digits. In addition, deep-learning models don’t process an entire dataset at once; rather, they break the data into small batches. Concretely, here’s one batch of our MNIST digits, with batch size of 128:\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Vector data** —2D tensors of shape (samples, features)\n",

    "## Vector data\n",

    " An actuarial dataset of people, where we consider each person’s age, ZIP code, and income. Each person can be characterized as a vector of 3 values, and thus an entire dataset of 100,000 people can be stored in a 2D tensor of shape (100000, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    " A dataset of text documents, where we represent each document by the counts of how many times each word appears in it (out of a dictionary of 20,000 common words). Each document can be encoded as a vector of 20,000 values (one count per word in the dictionary), and thus an entire dataset of 500 documents can be stored in a tensor of shape (500, 20000).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Timeseries data or sequence data\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever time matters in your data (or the notion of sequence order), it makes sense to store it in a 3D tensor with an explicit time axis. Each sample can be encoded as a sequence of vectors (a 2D tensor), and thus a batch of data will be encoded as a 3D tensor\n",

    "- **A dataset of stock prices**. Every minute, we store the current price of the stock, the highest price in the past minute, and the lowest price in the past minute. Thus every minute is encoded as a 3D vector, an entire day of tradingencoded as a 2D tensor of shape (390, 3) (there are 390 minutes in a trading day), and 250 days’ worth of data can be stored in a 3D tensor of shape (250, 390, 3). Here, each sample would be one day’s worth of data.\n",

    "- **A dataset of tweets**, where we encode each tweet as a sequence of 280 characters out of an alphabet of 128 unique characters. In this setting, each character can be encoded as a binary vector of size 128 (an all-zeros vector except for a 1 entry at the index corresponding to the character). Then each tweet can be encoded as a 2D tensor of shape (280, 128), and a dataset of 1 million tweets can be stored in a tensor of shape (1000000, 280, 128).\n",

    "## Image data\n",

    "Images typically have three dimensions: height, width, and color depth. Although grayscale images (like our MNIST digits) have only a single color channel and could thus be stored in 2D tensors, by convention image tensors are always 3D, with a one-dimensional color channel for grayscale images. A batch of 128 grayscale images of size 256 × 256 could thus be stored in a tensor of shape (128, 256, 256, 1), andbatch of 128 color images could be stored in a tensor of shape (128, 256, 256, 3)\n",

    "There are two conventions for shapes of images tensors: the channels-last convention (used by TensorFlow) and the channels-first convention (used by Theano). TensorFlow, places the color-depth axis at the end: (samples, height, width, color_depth). Meanwhile, Theano places the color depth axis right after the batch axis: (samples, color_depth, height, width). With the Theano convention, the previous examples would become (128, 1, 256, 256) and (128, 3, 256, 256). The Keras framework provides support for both formats.\n",

    "##### A video can be understood as a sequence of frames, each frame being a color image. Because each frame can be stored in a 3D tensor (height, width, color_depth), a sequence of frames can be stored in a 4D tensor (frames, height, width, color_depth), and thus a batch of different videos can be stored in a 5D tensor of shape (samples, frames, height, width, color_depth).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a 60-second, 144 × 256 YouTube video clip sampled at 4 frames per second would have 240 frames. A batch of four such video clips would be stored in a tensor of shape (4, 240, 144, 256, 3). That’s a total of 106,168,320 values! If the dtype of the tensor was float32, then each value would be stored in 32 bits, so the tensor would represent 405 MB. Heavy! Videos we encounter in real life are much lighter, because they aren’t stored in float32, and they’re typically compressed by a large factor (such as in the MPEG format).\n",
